# WordReplacer
 
Simple word replacer made with Python.

Can be run on the command line.
Works by taking two inputs from the user: replace and replaceWith.
It opens the textFile.txt file and copies the text from that into a variable, and then repalces the work you chose with the replaceWith input.


Contents:
WordReplacer.py - Python file which contains all the code.
textFile.txt - text file which contains text ready to be replaced.
